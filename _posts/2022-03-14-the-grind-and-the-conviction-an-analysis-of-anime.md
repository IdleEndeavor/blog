Anime is one of the most popular forms of entertainment in the world today. Anime has been watched by almost everyone I talk to these days. Interestingly, a majority of people are unaware that Doraemon, Ninja Hattori, and Pokemon are anime.

Of course, having everyone enjoy anime is a wonderful thing, but it's strange. How are so many people consuming stuff in a language that they don't understand? The content in English that is consumed around the world is understandable, and a large portion of the world's population speaks the language. But, as Japanese is not frequently taught or spoken, how is this happening?

Furthermore, anime is animation, and while individuals do not fully grow out of animated content as they get older, there is less high-quality animated stuff geared for adults than there is for children.

## The Power of Conviction

I thought about this for a long time. I was curious as to how this otherwise obscure content had risen to such acclaim and renown around the globe.

My brother was recently gushing about an anime he'd seen called Black Clover, and how the main character had an uncanny determination to attain his goal. That's when I realised I'd cracked it, listening to him put everything into place.

Of course. The **Power of Conviction** is the reason behind anime's international smash-hit success.

If you watch practically any anime, you'll notice that the protagonist has a goal. You might argue that this is self-evident, and you'd be correct. Characters with goals appear in a lot of shows, but what sets anime apart is how that desire is displayed throughout the series. Anime series present the main character's ambitions as the only thing that matters to them, and they bestow upon them an unwavering determination to attain it. Anime like My Hero Academia and Dragon Ball Z frequently depict their main characters roaring at the top of their lungs during a fight. It demonstrates the main character's entire and powerful conviction in achieving what they've set out to achieve.

Conviction is an unique and powerful force. It not only helps the person who has it achieve their goals, but it also motivates and inspires those who see them. The feeling you get when you see an anime hero eventually kill the villainous boss after a lot of buildup and strengthening of their belief in their mission is nearly addictive.

## The Power of the Grind

There is no obvious takeaway here, unlike most of the stuff I write. Conviction isn't simple to come by. It can't be obtained in a lab. Only our confidence in the eventual aim can give you conviction. Perhaps you don't have as much faith in your ultimate aim of becoming the Hokage as Naruto does. So, what are your options? Anime is a lot of fun to watch. But that won't be enough to get you through everything.

The takeaway is from a different aspect of anime that is almost exclusive to them. **The Grind**. Few films or television shows depict the struggle that goes into their protagonists' victories. It's simply assumed that they worked hard to get to where they are now or to become who they are. Anime series, on the other hand, follow its heroes from their humble beginnings to the height of grandeur. They depict the character losing repeatedly, to the point where we believe they won't be able to go on. But they get to their feet and fight once more. They raise a fist and continue on their way. And this directive choice works.

We feel like we're on the same road as the characters. We, the audience, not only accept but believe that the hero is deserving of the award at the end. We know he put in the effort, and we want the hero to triumph.

## The Conclusion

The conclusion here is to learn to put in the effort even when we don't want to or feel like it. It is to learn to work for your goal on a daily basis. Even if you don't believe in yourself, persistence and repetition of the grind will eventually pay off. It is going to be a win. Ultimately, the triumph you grind for will feel more earned than just acquired.

I hope my essay on the necessity of the grind and the power of conviction aided you in your quest to become a Hokage. If not, I hope you had a good time reading it!

Stay Safe out there and I'll see you in the next write!
