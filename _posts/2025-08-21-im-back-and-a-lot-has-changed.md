Hello again, I am thinking about coming back, and apologies for the super duper long hiatus.

It has been quite a while since I last wrote on this blog, and frankly; it was half me losing interest and the other half completely forgetting I used to have this blog at all. Looking back, this, alongside my journaling, used to be such a major part of my life, something that followed me over the course of years, something that was always at the back of my mind, I used to see it as an obligation in many ways, just something I always had and would do.

Now all of it seems so far away, feels like I'm starting anew, and I think it's a good thing. My last article was published 2 years ago and so much has changed since then, so so much! I think I've become a completely different person now, and with that being the case; a lot will be changing around here on this blog as well.

First up is the format of the stuff I post. I know I used to post polished up articles, well; as polished up an article as I could write as a 16-17 year old. I will be switching to more unstrucutred writing; random thoughts, quick findings, and maybe the occassional article (although; now that I've given myself the freedom to publish unpolished stuff, I don't think I'll be going back to heavily edited work)

Now for all that happened and why I left!

I moved to England! Well, my whole family did, and it was a bumpy ride, the whole process of moving here and settling down, but i think we're returning to a sense of settled-in normalcy now, and I'm starting university soon! During all this, I discovered that I had curly hair all along and that a lot of my frustrations could've been entirely avoided, I made a whole group of new friends, questioned and came to a newfound understanding of my sexuality, entered and promptly exited a goth phase, got a tattoo, got back onto social media, started working and learned that I suck at managing money, learned to drive and almost crashed a couple of times, got drunk and threw up so bad I had to be dragged home, started smoking???, and recently got diagnosed with ADHD, which has completely flipped my world but at the same time brought me answers to so much of my childhood and current existential behaviours and quirkc (I don't know how else to describe it), boy do we have a lot to talk about with the last one (expect a post about that at some point)

So yes, so much has changed, so so much. I can't even recognise myself from two years ago, I was and still am going through some of my older posts and drafted articles as I write this and it's so surreal, just everything's so weird! It's me but also like a version of me that's been covered over with so many layers since!

I've been thinking about reviving this blog for the past couple of weeks and today just felt like the right time somehow. So yeah, I'm thnking I'm back (in John Wick's voice), and we have so much to talk about! That's if I don't forget to write and then go on another hiatus by mistake of course.

Thank you to all those that used to, have since I stopped, and will continue to read my blog. If anything I write ever makes you stop and think about something for even a second, I will be the happiest person ever, thank you for being here with me, and I'll see you soon!
