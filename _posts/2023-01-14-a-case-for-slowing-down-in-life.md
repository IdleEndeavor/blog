If feel like we as people who care about being more productive are often unnecessarily obsessed with speed.

Speeding up YouTube Videos, speeding up Podcasts, speed reading etc etc.

It sort of makes content cheap and only drives in the negative sensational content into our minds because the good content doesn't stick out as much.

The next time you watch a video or read a book, slow down a little.

Instead of speeding things up to conserve time, pick things that matter to you to consume and savour them.

Slowing down brings more intentionality to the consumption and doesn't strip the content of the human element it's creator put in.
