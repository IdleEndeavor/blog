### The Problem

Instant gratification, our life today in the 21st century revolves around this ominous luxury. This very instant, if you want something to eat, you don’t have to cook; just order it in. If you want new clothes, scroll through amazon. If you want to sell something; you could do it in just about a few hours or even minutes through eBay. Why wait for nails to grow when you can stick on acrylic talons. Don’t have money but still want to buy something? just swipe that credit card. We’ve gotten so used to the supersonic speeds of things that people who pronounce a whole syllable seems slow.

At any given time; you’ve got your brain mapped out by Siri, and your friends mapped out by Facebook. This data isn't stored away in one place; it's available 24/7 anywhere, everywhere, anytime, every time. Cross-platform syncing, 12GB RAM and 100Mbps downloads are norms in the technological world.

Altogether over the last couple of years, the world has experienced the fastest advancements in all fields of Human Living. However, if there's anything that holds true universally in life; it's the fact that everything comes at a price. You may not have to pay today, but the due date will come. The instantaneous nature of our world seems all sunshine and rainbows, but there has to be a catch right? Well, I hate to be the harbinger of demise; but there is a catch.

Our over-dependence on technology to satisfy boredom and lack of patience, our lack of care for privacy and data, our misunderstanding of the side-effects of new technologies, the amount of control we hand over to mega-corporations are all things that could lead to a dystopian future. 

### So what's the solution?

I believe the solution is to have at least one day of Digital Detoxification every month. To make it a habit to read the terms and conditions of everything we use and understand it, be ready to say no. To reevaluate what we want for ourselves in the future and deliberately work towards it, let go of instant gratifications in the form of social media, video games and video on demand. All of these things are hard to do in this hyper-connected world, but it only gets harder the more we put it away. There is no better time than today to turn your life around from wasteful and depressed to oriented and focused.

Jordan B. Peterson's views resonate with me a lot on this topic. It's better to not be resentful in the future because of all we did not do but knew we could do. Why not work towards what's best for us and be satisfied with life. Life is pain, instead of finding ways to hide it away and pretend to be happy; why not attack it head-on, achieve what you've always wanted to achieve or at least try. Why not know you did the best you could and succeeded or failed than to regret your choices to not pursue the things you wanted to pursue and never be sure of what the outcome would have been.

### Conclusion

Although I’m excited about the future, and all that it will entail, I firmly stay rooted in my view that Instant Gratification comes with delayed Side-Effects. All of the effects of our over-dependence on instant gratification have only become more evident throughout these periods of lockdown. So it's high time we reevaluated our purpose in life and begin the process of building a bridge towards it.
