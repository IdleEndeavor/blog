There is no one more truly evil than a good Christian. One who prays for world peace and simultaneously ignores the injustices of the world, maybe even contributing to it.

I often wonder how they muster such dissonance and hypocrisy; enough to sleep tight at night. ‘How do you sleep at night having done what you do?’ Does this question ever occur to the good Christian that truly believes their ‘God’ loves all?

How can one stay silent in the midst of unimaginable horror? Horrors the perpetrators don’t even attempt to deny but proudly proclaim instead.

The arc of human history and progress does not bend towards justice. It never has. What justice we do have are scraps the brave fought for and died to keep.

‘Children die all the time in wars’ a staunch believer I know said. ‘What does something happening far away have to do with us now?’ Another one said, just before they turned to pray.

Tolerance and peace, what a fantastic way to peach people into submission.

After everything though, what I hate most is that in times of need; I reflexively call for help from God. This figure I so hate, whose followers I despise and whose existence I’ve logically concluded and fully believe to be a fantasy. The result of a catholic upbringing. A brick placed early.

There is no resolution here, I don’t know how to end this thought piece. I only have uncontrollable disgust that I desperately wish to shed by penning all of this down.
