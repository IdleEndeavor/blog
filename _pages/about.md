Hello there!
I’m Joshua, a Freelance Graphic Designer and Blogger. I love Computers, anything to do with Business and Productivity. 
This Blog is a collection of my thoughts and everything I learn throughout my Idle Endeavors in Life.

> "Everything we hear is an opinion, not a fact. Everything we see is a perspective, not the truth"
> -Marcus Aurelius

That’s my favorite quote by the way. I love this quote because it reminds me that everytime I feel down in life; it's my own outlook that's causing it and that I can change it as long as I'm willing to put in the work. It helps me understand that simply because someone says something negative about me; it doesn't automatically become true.

I've always had questions regarding my purpose in life. And so far I've come to the conclusion that my purpose in life is whatever I choose to make it. I can choose what I want to do, whether that be a blogger or druglord. It's out choices. There is no such thing as destiny, just choices. I hope to help atleast some of you gain valuable information from whatever I discover throughout my crusades to find the simplest most satisfyng way to live.

I certainly hope you have a Great time reading all of my Articles and that you gain something worthwhile from them.
I’m open to all your suggestions, so me know of your thoughts!
